      <p> Hello my name is Erika and I am a full stack web developer student. I just recently moved to Austin,Tx for this program. My homewtown is Jasper,Tx which is about a 5 hour drive located in the heart of southeast texas. This past may I graduated high school. I strive to do well in computer tech stuff, hopefully being able to build a strong website after this program. I plan to help my fan selling business grow. After this course I hope to get a good job, if not I plan on studying computer science or political science in Texas and doing the ROTC during. My future is not written out to me, so there can always be a change of plan, but I plan to progress in my life, and to build a stronger resume/mind...</p>
        
      <p>Also I love animals, they are pretty nice. Shout out to your cats Eric Scott, I bet they are freaking adorable! I have a dog named Rocket, he is Rottweiler.</p>
